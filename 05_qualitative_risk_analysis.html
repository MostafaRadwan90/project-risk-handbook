                    <p>After identifying potential risks, the next step is to analyze them. Risk analysis can be qualitative or quantitative. This chapter focuses on Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, a process for prioritizing identified individual project risks for further analysis or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact, as well as other characteristics.</p>

                        <h4>Definition: Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (from Slides & PMBOK® Guide)</h4>
                        <p>It is a subjective analysis of risks to (Slide 30):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Determine the probability and impact of all identified risks, in a subjective manner.</li>
                            <li>Determine which risks to analyze more fully in risk quantification or to skip risk quantification in favor of going directly to risk response planning.</li>
                            <li>Document non-critical, or non-top risks, for a watch list.</li>
                            <li>Determine the overall risk ranking for the project.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The PMBOK® Guide defines Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis as "the process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics." The key benefit is that it focuses efforts on high-priority risks.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>This process is generally a rapid and cost-effective means of establishing priorities for Plan Risk Responses and lays the foundation for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, if required.</p>

                    <h3>5.1.1 Critical Success Factors (Slide 31)</h3>
                    <p>The effectiveness of qualitative risk analysis hinges on several factors, often visualized as building upon each other:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Use an agreed-upon approach:</strong> Establish clear methods for evaluating probability, impact, urgency, manageability, and external impact.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use agreed-upon definitions of risk terms:</strong> Ensure common understanding of terms like "high probability" or "moderate impact." These are usually defined in the Risk Management Plan.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collect high-quality information about risks:</strong> The analysis is only as good as the data it's based on.</li>
                        <li><strong>Perform iterative qualitative risk analysis:</strong> Revisit the analysis as the project progresses and new information becomes available.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <div class="callout callout-remark">
                        <h4>Iterative Nature</h4>
                        <p>Qualitative risk analysis is not a one-time event. It should be revisited throughout the project lifecycle, especially when new risks are identified or circumstances change.</p>

                    <h3>5.3.1 Risk Probability and Impact Assessment (Slide 33)</h3>
                    <p>This involves investigating the likelihood that each specific risk will occur and the potential effect on project objectives if it does.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Assessment Process:</strong> Probability and impact are assessed for each identified risk, typically in interviews or dedicated risk workshops.</li>
                        <li><strong>Participants:</strong> Involves project team members, stakeholders familiar with risk categories, and potentially external experts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Qualitative Terms:</strong> Probability and impact are described using qualitative scales (e.g., Very High, High, Moderate, Low, Very Low). The specific definitions for these terms should be tailored to the project and documented in the Risk Management Plan.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="callout callout-example">
                        <h4>Example: Impact Scales</h4>
                        <p>For a project, "High" impact on cost might be defined as ">15% budget increase," while "High" impact on schedule might be ">4 weeks delay."</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>5.3.2 Probability and Impact Matrix (Slides 34, 35)</h3>
                    <p>As introduced in Chapter 3, the Probability and Impact (P&I) Matrix is a crucial tool here. It combines the assessed probability and impact of risks to assign a risk rating or score.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Risk Ratings:</strong> The matrix helps classify risks into categories like Low, Moderate, or High (often color-coded as green, yellow/orange, red).</li>
                        <li><strong>Organizational Definitions:</strong> The organization or project team must define which combinations of probability and impact result in these ratings. This is a key part of the Risk Management Plan.</li>
                        <li><strong>Guiding Responses:</strong> The risk score or rating helps prioritize risks and guides the urgency and type of risk response actions.</li>

                    </div>
                    <p>Slide 35 illustrates a numerical PxI matrix, where scores are calculated (e.g., Probability = 0.9, Impact on Cost = 0.8, Score = 0.72). These scores then map to risk levels.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High Probability & High Impact Risks:</strong> These are top priority. They often require further analysis (like quantitative analysis), aggressive risk management strategies, and immediate attention.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lower Risks:</strong> May require less emphasis. They might be accepted, placed on a watch list for monitoring, or managed with less aggressive strategies.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>5.3.3 Risk Data Quality Assessment</h3>
                    <p>This involves evaluating the degree to which the data about risks is useful for risk management. High-quality risk data is accurate, objective, comprehensive, and timely. If data quality is poor, the qualitative analysis may be unreliable.</p>

                    <h3>5.3.4 Risk Categorization</h3>
                    <p>Grouping risks by common sources (e.g., using the RBS), area of the project affected, or phase of the project can help reveal concentrations of risk and identify areas most exposed to uncertainty. This can lead to more effective risk responses.</p>

                    <h3>5.3.5 Risk Urgency Assessment</h3>
                    <p>Some risks may require immediate responses even if their overall risk rating isn't the highest. Urgency can be determined by factors like the time to impact, the time available to respond, and symptoms or triggers.</p>
