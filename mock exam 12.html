                <p>The five stages of the Loss Causation Model are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Control:</strong> Deficiencies in the management system, such as inadequate safety programs, standards, or compliance with standards. These are the ultimate root causes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basic Causes (Root Causes):</strong> The underlying reasons why immediate causes exist. These are typically categorized into:
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Personal Factors:</em> e.g., lack of knowledge/skill, improper motivation, physical/mental problems.</li>
                            <li><em>System/Job Factors:</em> e.g., inadequate leadership, poor design, inadequate maintenance, insufficient tools/equipment.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Immediate Causes (Direct Causes/Symptoms):</strong> The unsafe acts and/or unsafe conditions that directly preceded and led to the incident. These are the most visible causes.
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Substandard Acts (Unsafe Acts):</em> e.g., operating without authority, failure to use PPE.</li>

            <div class="question-text">Question 3 (5 Marks)<br>You are managing a construction project and have identified three key risk factors with associated probabilities and impacts (cost/schedule). Briefly describe how you would calculate the Expected Monetary Value (EMV) for one of these risk factors and how this EMV helps in decision-making. (Assume a risk factor with P=0.3 and Impact Cost=$50,000).</div>
            <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-show-answer" onclick="toggleAnswer('mock10_q3_sa')">Show Answer</button>
            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Calculating Expected Monetary Value (EMV):</strong></p>
                <p>For a given risk factor, the Expected Monetary Value (EMV) is calculated by multiplying the probability (P) of the risk occurring by its financial impact (I) if it does occur.</p>
                <p>For the example risk factor (P=0.3, Impact Cost=$50,000):</p>
                <p>EMV = Probability × Impact</p>
                <p>EMV = 0.3 × (-$50,000)  <em>(Impact is negative as it's a cost)</em></p>
                <p>EMV = -$15,000</p>
                <p><strong>How EMV Helps in Decision-Making:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Risk Prioritization:</strong> EMV provides a quantitative measure to rank risks. Risks with higher negative EMVs (for threats) or higher positive EMVs (for opportunities) are generally given higher priority.</li>
                    <li><strong>Response Strategy Selection:</strong> The EMV can help decide if the cost of a risk response is justified. For example, if a mitigation action costs $5,000 but reduces the EMV of a threat from -$15,000 to -$2,000, it might be considered worthwhile.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contingency Reserve Estimation:</strong> The sum of EMVs for various identified risks can be one input into determining the overall contingency reserve needed for the project.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Tree Analysis:</strong> EMV is a fundamental component in decision tree analysis, helping to choose the most financially favorable path among different alternatives involving uncertainty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicating Risk Severity:</strong> It provides a common, quantifiable language for discussing the potential financial implications of risks with stakeholders.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: The project manager is proposing to allocate some ownership/effort of the opportunity (cost savings from a combined system) to a third party (the competitor) for mutual benefit.
