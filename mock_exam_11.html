                <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>SWOT Analysis:</strong></p>
                <p>SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning and risk identification technique that examines a project or organization from four perspectives: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.</p>
                <p><strong>How Components Help Identify Risks:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strengths (Internal, Positive):</strong> These are internal attributes and resources that support a successful project outcome. Risks identified from strengths might include failing to leverage these strengths adequately or the risk of losing a key strength (e.g., a skilled team member departing). Opportunities can also arise from leveraging strengths.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weaknesses (Internal, Negative):</strong> These are internal attributes and resource limitations that are detrimental to project success. Weaknesses are direct sources of threats or negative risks for the project (e.g., lack of specific expertise, outdated technology, poor internal processes).</li>
                    <li><strong>Opportunities (External, Positive):</strong> These are external factors or situations that the project could exploit to its advantage. They represent positive risks that, if captured, can benefit the project (e.g., a new emerging market, favorable government regulations, new technology becoming available).</li>
                    <li><strong>Threats (External, Negative):</strong> These are external factors or situations that could negatively impact the project. They represent negative risks that need to be managed (e.g., new competitors, economic downturn, unfavorable weather, supply chain disruptions).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By systematically considering these four areas, SWOT analysis helps to generate a broad list of both positive and negative risks related to internal capabilities and the external environment.</p>

            <div class="question-text">Question 2 (5 Marks)<br>What is "Risk Reassessment" and why is it an important part of the Control Risk process?</div>

                <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Risk Reassessment:</strong></p>
                <p>Risk reassessment is the activity of periodically reviewing and updating the project's risk status throughout its lifecycle. It involves re-evaluating previously identified risks to see if their probability, impact, or priority has changed, identifying any new risks that have emerged, and closing out risks that are no longer relevant.</p>
                <p><strong>Importance in Control Risk Process:</strong></p>
                <p>Risk reassessment is important in the Control Risk process because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Projects are dynamic:</strong> The project environment, assumptions, and conditions change over time, leading to new risks or changes in existing ones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ensures continued relevance:</strong> It ensures that the risk register and risk responses remain current and relevant to the project's actual situation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identification of new risks:</strong> As the project progresses, new information becomes available, and new uncertainties or potential problems may emerge that were not foreseen initially.</li>
                    <li><strong>Effectiveness of responses:</strong> Reassessment helps determine if implemented risk responses are effective or if adjustments are needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Closing outdated risks:</strong> It allows for the formal closure of risks that have passed, have been successfully addressed, or are no longer applicable, focusing resources on current threats and opportunities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iterative improvement:</strong> It supports the iterative nature of risk management, ensuring ongoing vigilance and adaptation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: Based on Handbook Chapter 9, Slide 69.</p>

            <div class="question-text">Question 3 (5 Marks)<br>Define "Accident" and "Incident" in the context of safety management. How are they related?</div>
            <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-show-answer" onclick="toggleAnswer('mock9_q3_sa')">Show Answer</button>
            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Accident:</strong></p>
                <p>In safety management, an accident is an unplanned event that *results* in unintended harm (such as injury or ill health to people) or damage (to property, equipment, or the environment).</p>
                <p><strong>Incident:</strong></p>
                <p>An incident is a broader term. It is an event that *could have resulted* or *did result* in unintended harm or damage. This means an incident encompasses both accidents (where harm/damage occurred) and near misses (where harm/damage could have occurred but did not).</p>
                <p><strong>Relationship:</strong></p>
                <p>All accidents are incidents, but not all incidents are accidents. An incident is the overarching category. If an incident results in actual harm or damage, it is then classified as an accident. If an incident had the potential for harm but no actual harm or damage occurred, it is often referred to as a "near miss" (which is still a type of incident).</p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: Based on Handbook Chapter 11, Slide 85 (and 86 for near miss context).</p>

                <li>C. Acceptance</li>
                <li>D. Transfer (Assuming 'Analysis' D was a typo and Transfer is the intended concept)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>Correct Answer: D (Transfer)</strong></p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: "Transfer" is the direct strategy. If "Transfer" is not an option and only A, B, C, D (Analysis) were given, the question is flawed. "Deflection" implies transferring the impact. (Handbook Chapter 7, Slides 59-60)</p>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>Correct Answer: D</strong></p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: When new, unanticipated risks surface, the immediate priority is to understand them. This requires performing an updated risk identification to formally capture these new risks, followed by analysis (qualitative and potentially quantitative) to understand their probability and impact before appropriate responses or plan revisions can be made. (Handbook Chapter 4, Chapter 9 Slide 68)</p>

                <li>C. Allocation of specific Contingency Reserves to fund the fallback actions.</li>
                <li>D. Implementing a pre-defined change to the project scope if the primary response fails.</li>

                <p><strong>Correct Answer: A</strong></p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: A fallback plan outlines specific actions if a primary response fails or an accepted risk occurs. Developing alternative options (B), allocating reserves (C), and a pre-defined scope change (D) can be parts of such a plan. Subcontracting the *entire remaining project* (A) is a very drastic step, more akin to a major strategic shift or project termination/re-planning rather than a typical fallback action for a single critical risk's failed response. (Handbook Chapter 7, Slide 52)</p>

                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: A contingency plan is a pre-defined set of actions (alternative strategies) to be implemented if a specific risk trigger indicates the risk is occurring.
