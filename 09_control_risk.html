                    <h3>9.2.1 Risk Reassessment (Slide 69)</h3>
                    <div class="callout callout-definition">
                        <h4>Definition: Risk Reassessment</h4>
                        <p>Risk reassessment involves periodically reviewing and updating the project's risk status. It is not a one-time activity but an ongoing effort throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Key activities during risk reassessment include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Identification of new risks:</strong> As the project progresses, new uncertainties may emerge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reassessment of current risks:</strong> The probability, impact, or priority of previously identified risks may change.</li>
                        <li><strong>The closing of risks that are outdated:</strong> Risks that are no longer relevant (e.g., they have occurred and been dealt with, or the window of opportunity/threat has passed) should be closed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Slide 69 emphasizes that "Project risk reassessments should be regularly scheduled." The frequency and detail depend on how the project progresses relative to its objectives.</p>

                    <h3>9.2.2 Risk Audits (Slide 70)</h3>
                    <div class="callout callout-definition">
                        <h4>Definition: Risk Audit</h4>
                        <p>Risk audits examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with identified risks and their root causes, as well as the effectiveness of the overall risk management process.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Key aspects of risk audits:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To evaluate the effectiveness of risk management, not just individual responses. To identify lessons learned for the current and future projects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Performed at an appropriate frequency, which may be defined in the Risk Management Plan.</li>
                        <li><strong>Format:</strong> Can be part of routine project review meetings or held as separate risk audit meetings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Defined Objectives:</strong> "The format for the audit and its objectives should be clearly defined before the audit is conducted." (Slide 70)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="callout callout-tip">
                        <h4>Focus of a Risk Audit</h4>
                        <p>A risk audit might ask questions like: Were the planned risk responses implemented correctly? Were they effective? Was the risk identification process thorough? Are risk owners fulfilling their responsibilities?</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>9.2.3 Variance and Trend Analysis (Slide 71)</h3>
                    <div class="callout callout-definition">
                        <h4>Definition: Variance and Trend Analysis</h4>
                        <p>Variance analysis compares planned results (baselines) to actual results to identify deviations. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine if performance is improving or deteriorating.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>In the context of risk control:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Monitoring Performance:</strong> Used for monitoring overall project performance against cost and schedule baselines.</li>
                        <li><strong>Forecasting Deviations:</strong> "Outcomes from these analyses may forecast potential deviation of the project at completion from cost and schedule targets." (Slide 71)</li>
                        <li><strong>Indicating Risk Impact:</strong> "Deviation from the baseline plan may indicate the potential impact of threats or opportunities." (Slide 71) For example, consistent cost overruns in a particular area might signal an unmanaged risk or an ineffective response.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>9.2.4 Technical Performance Measurement (Slide 72)</h3>
                    <div class="callout callout-definition">
                        <h4>Definition: Technical Performance Measurement (TPM)</h4>
                        <p>Technical performance measurement compares technical accomplishments during project execution to the schedule of technical achievement. It requires the definition of objective, quantifiable measures of technical performance, which can be used to compare actual results against targets.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Key aspects of TPM:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quantifiable Measures:</strong> Relies on objective metrics (e.g., transaction processing speed, defect rates, weight, power consumption).</li>
                        <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Actual technical achievements are compared against planned achievements at specific milestones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Forecasting Success:</strong> "Deviation, such as demonstrating more or less functionality than planned at a milestone, can help to forecast the degree of success in achieving the project’s scope." (Slide 72) Deviations can indicate the materialization of technical risks or opportunities.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>9.2.5 Reserve Analysis</h3>
                    <p>This technique is listed under Tools & Techniques on Slide 67. It involves monitoring the status of contingency and management reserves.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To determine if the remaining reserves are adequate for the remaining risks in the project.</li>
                        <li><strong>Action:</strong> If reserves are being depleted faster than expected, or if new significant risks emerge, it may trigger a need for additional funding or a change in risk response strategies.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>9.2.6 Meetings</h3>
                    <p>Regular risk review meetings are essential for controlling risks. These meetings provide a forum to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Discuss the status of identified risks and their responses.</li>
                        <li>Identify new risks.</li>
                        <li>Reassess existing risks.</li>
                        <li>Review the effectiveness of the risk management process.</li>
                        <li>Communicate risk information to stakeholders.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>9.3.2 Change Requests (Slide 73)</h3>
                    <p>As risks are controlled and responses implemented, changes to the project plan or baselines may be necessary. These are formally managed through change requests.</p>

                    <div class="callout callout-definition">

                        <p>Activities that ensure that future performance of the project work is aligned with the project management plan. These aim to reduce the probability of negative impacts from potential future risks.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Change requests can also include defect repairs or updates to formal project documents or the project management plan.</p>

                    <p>Various components of the project management plan (e.g., baselines, subsidiary plans) and project documents (especially the Risk Register and Risk Report) are updated to reflect the outcomes of risk control activities, new risks, closed risks, and the effectiveness of responses.</p>
