                        <p>Based on Slide 75, safety can be understood as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The absence of danger.</li>
                            <li>A state of protection.</li>
                            <li>A risk-free condition.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It's important to also consider <strong>health besides safety</strong>, as occupational health hazards can have long-term impacts even if they don't result in immediate injury.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>In a project context, safety involves proactive measures to prevent accidents, injuries, and occupational illnesses. It's about creating an environment where work can be performed without undue risk to individuals.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Falls from height (e.g., from scaffolding, roofs).</li>

                        <li>Caught-in or -between hazards (e.g., in machinery, collapsing trenches).</li>

                    <h3>10.5.1 Purpose of the H&S Plan (Slide 79)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To assist and contribute to the establishment of a safe, healthy, and environmentally sound working environment.</li>

                    <p>The plan should include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Details of the project.</li>

                        <li><strong>Availability at Bid Stage:</strong> "When the Safety Plan is prepared and available at the bid stage, it allows contractors foresight of conditions which may alter their bids." This promotes transparency and allows contractors to price safety measures appropriately.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prerequisite - Risk Assessment:</strong> "The Safety Plan cannot be developed until a project risk assessment has been made, in order to list all the issues and obtain an overview of significant hazards and risks, and to specify solutions to them if possible."</li>

                    <h2>10.7 Developing the Construction Phase Health and Safety Plan (Slides 82, 83)</h2>
                    <p>This plan is typically developed by the main contractor and focuses on practical implementation of safety measures during construction. Key principles and focus areas include:</p>
                    <h3>10.7.1 Core Principles (Slide 82)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Avoid risks altogether</strong> where possible (elimination).</li>
                        <li><strong>Evaluate risks that cannot be avoided</strong> (risk assessment).</li>
                        <li><strong>Combat risks at source</strong> (e.g., removing a problem rather than just posting a warning sign). This aligns with the hierarchy of controls.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adapt work to the individual,</strong> and give them control over speed of work where possible (ergonomics and worker well-being).</li>
                        <li><strong>Make use of technological progress</strong> to improve safety.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>10.7.2 Further Principles (Slide 83)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Give priority to solutions protecting the whole workplace rather than individuals</strong> (e.g., guardrails are preferred over individual safety harnesses, representing collective protection over personal protection).</li>
                        <li><strong>Make sure everyone knows what they need to do to remain safe and healthy</strong> (communication, training, and information).</li>
                        <li><strong>Achieve a positive organizational safety culture</strong> where risk control is accepted as a normal part of life rather than an add-on.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="callout callout-tip">
                        <h4>Hierarchy of Controls</h4>
                        <p>Many of these principles align with the widely recognized "Hierarchy of Controls" in safety management: Elimination, Substitution, Engineering Controls, Administrative Controls, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The plan should prioritize controls higher up this hierarchy.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Safety:</strong> The absence of danger, a state of protection, and a risk-free condition, encompassing both immediate safety and long-term health.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> Potential sources of harm common in construction (e.g., falls, struck-by).</li>
                            <li><strong>Unsafe Acts:</strong> Worker behaviors that deviate from safe practices and can lead to accidents.</li>
                            <li><strong>Health and Safety Plan:</strong> A formal document detailing project H&S requirements, anticipated hazards, and control measures. It's crucial from the bid stage through construction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pre-tender H&S Plan:</strong> Provides H&S information to bidders.</li>
                            <li><strong>Construction Phase H&S Plan:</strong> Developed by the main contractor, focusing on avoiding/evaluating risks, combating them at source, and fostering a positive safety culture.</li>
