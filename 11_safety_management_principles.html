                        <h4>What is a Safety Management Plan (SMP)? (Slide 92)</h4>
                        <p>A Safety Management Plan (SMP) is a document detailing how safety will be managed on a certain construction project. It is usually tailor-made for each construction project to ensure that the project-specific safety requirements are considered.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>The SMP is a critical document that outlines the systematic approach to ensuring safety throughout the project lifecycle.</p>

                    <h3>11.2.1 Contents of the Safety Management Plan (Slide 93)</h3>
                    <p>A comprehensive SMP typically includes the following components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Safety Policy and Objectives:</strong> The organization's commitment and specific safety goals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Project's Safety Organization Chart:</strong> Defines roles, responsibilities, and reporting lines for safety matters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Training Requirements:</strong> Specifies training for project staff, particularly safety staff.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hazard Identification Procedures:</strong> How hazards will be identified.</li>
                        <li><strong>Risk Assessment Procedures:</strong> How risks associated with identified hazards will be assessed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Risk Response Planning:</strong> How control measures for risks will be planned and implemented. (This links back to the general risk management processes).</li>
                        <li><strong>Emergency Response:</strong> Plans and procedures for dealing with emergencies (e.g., fire, medical, spills).</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety Inspections and Safety Audits:</strong> Procedures for regularly inspecting the workplace and auditing the SMP's effectiveness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accident Investigation Procedures:</strong> How accidents and incidents (including near misses) will be investigated to prevent recurrence.</li>

                        <h4>What is a Safety Policy?</h4>
                        <p>A Safety Policy is a formal statement by an organization of its intentions and principles in relation to its overall occupational health and safety performance. It provides a framework for action and for the setting of its OHS objectives and targets.</p>
                        <p>Key characteristics and aspects (from slides):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typically set by senior management/team.</li>
                            <li>Safety professionals' input is desired.</li>
                            <li>Should be signed by a senior manager on site (demonstrating commitment).</li>
                            <li>Provides the overall thrust for Safety in the project.</li>
                            <li>Must be distributed, communicated, posted, and used in other ways for full effect.</li>
                            <li>It's a public statement of commitment.</li>
                            <li>Visible evidence of top management support.</li>

                            <li>Primary vehicle for communicating the organization's commitment to safety improvement.</li>
                            <li>Framework to set objectives and targets.</li>

                    <p>Safety objectives are specific goals derived from the safety policy. They should be clearly defined and measurable.</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Input and output oriented (i.e., relate to actions taken and results achieved).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Slide 97 emphasizes that objectives should be <strong>SMART</strong> (Slide 98):</p>
