                <p><strong>Correct Answer: D</strong></p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: Workarounds are unplanned responses implemented during Control Risks when unforeseen risks occur or planned responses fail. (Handbook Chapter 7, Slide 53; Chapter 9, Slide 73)</p>

                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: Problematic question if &#x27;Transfer&#x27; isn&#x27;t an option. &#x27;Deflection&#x27; implies shifting. If no formal transfer, the original party might passively accept residual consequences. (Best fit from limited options).</p>

                <p><strong>Correct Answer: A</strong></p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: Subcontracting the entire project is a major strategic shift or primary transfer, not typically a mere condition within a fallback plan for a specific risk&#x27;s failed response. Other options are more aligned with fallback actions.</p>
