                <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Residual Risks:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Residual risks are those risks that remain *after* risk responses have been implemented. No risk response is usually 100% effective in eliminating a risk (unless it's avoidance), so some level of risk often remains. These are the "leftover" risks that the project team may decide to accept or monitor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A project team identifies a risk of a 2-week delay due to potential bad weather. They implement a mitigation strategy by adding 1 week of buffer to the schedule for this activity. The residual risk is that the bad weather could still cause more than 1 week of delay (e.g., a 1.5-week delay would mean 0.5 weeks of impact despite the buffer).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Secondary Risks:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Secondary risks are new risks that arise as a *direct result* of implementing a specific risk response. The action taken to address one risk creates another.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> To mitigate the risk of in-house development delays for a software module (original risk), the project manager decides to outsource the development to a third-party vendor (risk response). A secondary risk created by this outsourcing decision could be "the vendor fails to deliver on time or to the required quality standards," or "loss of intellectual property to the vendor."</li>

                <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>The main deliverables (outputs) of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis procedure are primarily updates to project documents, most significantly the <strong>Risk Register</strong>. These updates include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Risk Prioritization / Ranked List of Risks:</strong> Identified risks are ranked or prioritized based on their assessed probability and impact. This helps focus attention on the most significant risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Ratings/Scores:</strong> Each risk is assigned a rating (e.g., High, Medium, Low) or a score derived from the Probability and Impact Matrix.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watchlist:</strong> A list of low-priority risks that do not require immediate proactive management but should be monitored.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risks Grouped by Categories:</strong> Risks may be categorized (e.g., by source using RBS, by project phase affected) to identify concentrations of risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Urgency Information:</strong> Identification of risks that may require urgent responses, even if their overall P&I score isn't the absolute highest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basis of Assessment:</strong> The rationale behind the probability and impact assessments for each risk, providing context for the prioritization.</li>
                    <li><strong>List of Risks for Additional Analysis and Response:</strong> High-priority risks that will proceed to quantitative analysis (if planned) or directly to risk response planning.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other project documents that might be updated include the Assumption Log (if assumptions are challenged or new ones arise during analysis) and potentially an Issue Log if some items are deemed current problems rather than future risks.</p>

                <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Mitigate Risk Response Strategy:</strong></p>
                <p>Risk mitigation is a response strategy for negative risks (threats) where the project team takes active steps to reduce the probability of the risk occurring and/or its potential impact on project objectives if it does occur. The goal is to bring the risk exposure down to an acceptable threshold, rather than eliminating the risk entirely (as in avoidance).</p>
                <p><strong>Three Examples of Mitigation Actions:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Adopting Less Complex Processes:</strong> Simplifying a complex technical approach or manufacturing process can reduce the likelihood of errors, defects, or delays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conducting More Tests or Inspections:</strong> Increased testing of a software module or more frequent quality inspections of construction work can reduce the probability of failures or defects reaching the end-user or next project phase, thereby reducing their impact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choosing a More Stable or Reliable Supplier:</strong> If there's a risk of supply chain disruption, selecting a supplier with a proven track record of reliability, even if slightly more expensive, can reduce the probability of delivery delays or quality issues.</li>
                </ol>
