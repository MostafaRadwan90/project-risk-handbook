                    <p>Accident investigation is a critical reactive component of safety management. Its purpose is not to assign blame, but to identify root causes to prevent recurrence. This chapter covers the principles, processes, and techniques involved in effective accident and incident investigation, including the widely used Loss Causation Model.</p>

                    <h2>15.1 Importance of Investigating Accidents & Incidents (Slides 140, 141)</h2>
                    <p>Slide 140 introduces the concept of the "accident pyramid" or "safety triangle," which illustrates the typical ratio of incidents:</p>
                    <div class="accident-pyramid-container">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3G3E4uI.png" alt="Accident Pyramid Concept">
                        <p><em>Conceptual Accident Pyramid (based on Slide 140): 1 Major Accident, 10 Minor Accidents, 30 Property Damage Incidents, 600 Near Misses/Incidents with No Loss.</em></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Key takeaways from this concept:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Many More Incidents than Accidents:</strong> There are significantly more near misses and minor incidents than serious accidents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Common Causes:</strong> "The causes and potential are exactly the same" for near misses and accidents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Free Lessons:</strong> "Lessons learned from near misses are free" â€“ they provide opportunities to improve safety before a loss-producing event occurs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Slide 141 emphasizes "Finding HI-POs" (High Potential Incidents). Even if an event didn't result in a major loss this time, if it had the potential to, it should be investigated thoroughly. This means:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All events should be reported.</li>
                        <li>All events having high potential (HI-PO) should be investigated fully.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    <h2>15.2 Purpose of Investigations (Slide 142)</h2>
                    <p>The primary objectives of conducting an accident/incident investigation are to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Describe what happened:</strong> Establish a clear sequence of events.</li>
                        <li><strong>Determine basic (root) causes:</strong> Go beyond immediate causes to find underlying systemic issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Evaluate the risks:</strong> Understand the likelihood and severity of similar events.</li>
                        <li><strong>Develop controls:</strong> Recommend corrective and preventive actions to prevent recurrence.</li>
                        <li><strong>Define trends:</strong> Identify patterns in incidents over time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Demonstrate concern:</strong> Show management's commitment to safety and worker well-being.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h4>Focus on Prevention, Not Blame</h4>
                        <p>A fundamental principle of modern accident investigation is that its goal is to learn and prevent future incidents, not to find someone to blame. A blame culture discourages reporting and hinders learning.</p>

Crane operator had no direct visibility. Happened at shift change. Consultant had no safety engineer on site. Contractor's risk assessment was preliminary, not reviewed. No method statement for steel transportation/installation.</p>
