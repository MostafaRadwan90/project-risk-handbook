            <h4>9.2.1 Risk Reassessment</h4>
            <div class="card mb-2">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>Control Risks often involves reassessing current risks. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identification of new risks that have emerged.</li>
                        <li>Reassessment of current risks (their probability, impact, priority may have changed).</li>
                        <li>Closing of risks that are outdated or no longer relevant.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Project risk reassessments should be regularly scheduled. The amount and detail of repetition depend on how the project progresses relative to its objectives.</p>

            <div class="card mb-2">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>Risk audits examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with identified risks and their root causes, as well as the effectiveness of the overall risk management process. They are performed at an appropriate frequency and can be part of routine project review meetings or separate audit meetings. The format and objectives should be clearly defined beforehand.</p>

            <div class="card mb-2">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>This involves comparing planned results to actual results to monitor overall project performance. Outcomes can forecast potential deviations from cost and schedule targets at completion.

            <div class="card mb-2">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>Compares technical accomplishments during project execution to the schedule of technical achievement. It requires objective, quantifiable measures of technical performance to compare actual results against targets. Deviations (e.g., more or less functionality than planned at a milestone) can help forecast the degree of success in achieving the project’s scope.</p>

            <div class="card mb-2">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>Throughout project execution, some risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or schedule. Reserve analysis compares the amount of contingency reserves remaining to the amount of risk remaining at any time in the project to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate.</p>

            <h3>9.3 Outputs: Change Requests</h3>
            <p>Implementing contingency plans or workarounds frequently results in change requests. These can be for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Corrective Actions:</strong> Activities that realign the performance of the project work with the project management plan. This includes implementing contingency plans and workarounds for emerging risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Preventive Actions:</strong> Activities that ensure future performance of the project work is aligned with the project management plan.</li>

            <h2>Chapter 10: Health and Safety Plan Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>A Health and Safety (H&S) Plan is a critical document, especially in construction, designed to ensure a safe working environment.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>The Safety Plan is produced to assist and contribute to the establishment of a safe, healthy, and environmentally sound working environment. Its aims are to benefit all workers, management personnel on site, neighbors, and third parties, and to minimize the environmental impact of the work.</p>
                    <p>It should include details of the project, its H&S requirements, anticipated site hazards and conditions, and their means of control.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's every contractor's responsibility to be aware of the Safety Plan and ensure workers comply.</li>
                        <li>Availability at the bid stage allows contractors to foresee conditions that may alter bids.</li>
                        <li>It cannot be fully developed until a project risk assessment has been made to list issues, hazards, and specify solutions.</li>

            <h3>10.2 Developing the Construction Phase Health and Safety Plan</h3>
            <p>Typically developed by the main contractor, this plan details practical H&S management during construction. Key principles for development include:</p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">Where possible, <strong>avoid risks altogether</strong>.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Evaluate risks</strong> that cannot be avoided.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Combat risks at source</strong> (e.g., remove a problem rather than just post a warning).</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Adapt work to the individual, giving control over work speed where possible.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Make use of technological progress to improve safety.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Give priority to solutions protecting the <strong>whole workplace</strong> (collective protection) rather than individuals (personal protection, e.g., guardrails over harnesses).</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Ensure everyone knows what they need to do to remain safe and healthy (communication, training).</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Achieve a positive organizational safety culture where risk control is a normal part of life, not an add-on.</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Hazard vs. Risk</h4>
                <p>A <strong>Hazard</strong> is the source of potential harm (e.g., a trailing cable).</p>
                <p><strong>Risk</strong> is the chance (probability) that someone will be harmed by the hazard, combined with the severity of that harm (e.g., the risk of tripping on the cable and spraining an ankle).</p>

            <h3>11.2 Loss Control</h3>
            <p>Loss control refers to anything done to reduce loss from the risks of business. It has three main aspects:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The prevention of loss exposures.</li>
                <li>The reduction of loss when loss-producing events occur.</li>
                <li>The termination or avoidance of risk.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>11.3 Safety Management Plan (SMP)</h3>
            <p>An SMP is a document detailing how safety will be managed on a specific construction project. It's usually tailor-made for each project.</p>
            <p><strong>Typical Contents of an SMP:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Safety Policy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Typically set by senior management/team, with input from safety professionals.</li>
                <li>Signed by a senior manager on site.</li>
                <li>Provides overall thrust for Safety in the project.</li>
                <li>Must be distributed, communicated, posted, and used effectively.</li>
                <li>It's a public statement of commitment and visible evidence of top management support.</li>
                <li>It's management's promise to workers and is a relatively long-lived document.</li>
                <li>Primary vehicle for communicating the organization’s commitment to safety improvement.</li>
                <li>Framework to set objectives and targets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>(Source: Slides: Safety Management (Lec 11), Slides 11-13 (renumbered 94-96))</em></p>

            <p><strong>Safety Objectives:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Typically set for the project.</li>
                <li>Quantified where practicable.</li>
                <li>Input and output oriented.</li>
                <li>Should be <strong>SMART</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>S</strong>pecific (clear, well-defined)</li>
                        <li><strong>M</strong>easurable (quantifiable to track progress)</li>
                        <li><strong>A</strong>greed/Achievable/Assignable (realistic, attainable, with clear responsibility)</li>
                        <li><strong>R</strong>elevant/Realistic (pertinent to safety policy and goals)</li>
                        <li><strong>T</strong>ime-bound (defined timeframe for achievement)</li>
                    </ul>

            <h4>11.3.2 Hazard Identification in SMP</h4>
            <p>Thinking about how loss or harm could occur helps identify hazards and broaden assessment scope. Consider all possibilities, not just the most obvious ones.</p>
            <p><strong>Aids to Hazard Identification:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accident/Incident Investigations</li>
                <li>Accident Statistics</li>
                <li>"Near Miss" reports</li>
                <li>Workplace Inspections/Audits</li>
                <li>Discussions with Operators</li>
                <li>Documentation/Legislation/Safety Alerts</li>
                <li>Safety Organisations & Safety Publications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Identify potential hazards associated with a task from: Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), equipment manuals, observing practices, observing start-up procedures, abnormal working conditions, the working environment, reviewing sickness & accident records, and asking operators.</p>
            <p><strong>Energy-related Hazards:</strong> Don't forget hazards due to energy sources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stored Energy:</strong> Hydraulic/Compressive, Kinetic/Mechanical, Pneumatic, Electrical.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Energy:</strong> Temperature, Noise, Vibration, Radiation, Pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemical Energy:</strong> Foaming/Gassing, Exothermic Reactions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>(Source: Slides: Safety Management (Lec 11), Slides 18-21 (renumbered 101-104))</em></p>

            <h4>11.3.3 Risk Assessment in SMP</h4>
            <p>Risk assessment is the systematic identification of hazards associated with locations, equipment, auxiliary equipment, and tasks. It involves evaluating and documenting the risks to enable risk management and loss prevention.</p>
            <p><strong>Output of a Risk Assessment should:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify all hazards involved (with location/equipment/task).</li>
                <li>Identify what controls and defenses are already in place.</li>
                <li>Evaluate the severity of exposure to the hazard.</li>
                <li>Estimate the probability (likelihood) that exposure will take place.</li>
                <li>Qualitatively Score, or Rank, the risk (e.g., Negligible, Low, Medium, High, Unacceptable).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The assessment is then reviewed for options to reduce inherent risk using a Risk Management System approach (Identify, Evaluate, Develop a plan [Terminate, Treat, Tolerate, Transfer], Implement, Monitor).</p>
