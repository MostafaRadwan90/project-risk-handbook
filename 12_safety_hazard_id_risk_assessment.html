                    <p>Building upon the foundational safety vocabulary, this chapter delves deeper into the critical processes of Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment specifically within the context of occupational health and safety. We will explore practical aids, systematic approaches, and the expected outcomes of these vital safety management activities, concluding with an overview of a comprehensive risk management system.</p>

                    <h2>12.1 In-depth Hazard Identification (Slides 101-104)</h2>
                    <p>Effective hazard identification requires a broad perspective and the use of various information sources.</p>

                    <h3>12.1.1 Broadening the Scope of Assessment (Slide 101)</h3>
                    <p>Slide 101 emphasizes that "Thinking about how loss or harm could occur can help to identify hazards and broaden the scope of an assessment." It provides an example:</p>
                    <div class="callout callout-example">
                        <h4>Example: Working on a Roof</h4>
                        <p>When assessing the task of working on a roof, the immediate focus might be on the workers at height falling off or through the roof. However, a broader assessment should also consider other potential harms, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Objects (tools, materials) being dropped onto a passer-by below.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The key takeaway is to <strong>"Consider all the possibilities."</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>12.1.2 Aids to Hazard Identification (Slide 102)</h3>
                    <p>Various resources and methods can assist in comprehensively identifying hazards:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accident / Incident Investigations:</strong> Past events provide valuable lessons on what can go wrong.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accident Statistics:</strong> Data can highlight common hazards in particular industries or tasks.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Near Miss" Reports:</strong> These are crucial indicators of potential future accidents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Workplace Inspections / Audits:</strong> Proactive checks of the work environment and practices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Discussions with Operators:</strong> Frontline workers often have the best understanding of the hazards they face.</li>
                        <li><strong>Documentation / Legislation / Safety Alerts:</strong> Manufacturer's instructions, legal requirements, and industry alerts can highlight known hazards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety Organisations & Safety Publications:</strong> Resources from professional bodies and publications.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>12.1.3 Identifying Potential Hazards from Various Sources (Slide 103)</h3>
                    <p>To identify all potential hazards associated with a task, information should be gathered from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) / Safety Data Sheets (SDS):</strong> For chemical hazards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Equipment Manuals:</strong> Manufacturer's safety information.</li>
                        <li><strong>Observe Practices:</strong> How work is actually done (which may differ from procedures).</li>
                        <li><strong>Observe Start-up Procedures.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Abnormal Working Conditions:</strong> Consider non-routine situations.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Working Environment:</strong> Lighting, ventilation, noise, housekeeping, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Review Sickness & Accident Records.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Ask the Operators!</strong> (Re-emphasizing their importance).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="callout callout-remark">
                        <h4>Key to Sufficient Risk Assessment (Slide 103)</h4>
                        <p>"Only a full understanding of what is actually done, and what equipment and materials are used, will result in the completion of a suitable & sufficient risk assessment."</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>12.1.4 Hazard Identification - Energies (Slide 104)</h3>
                    <p>Beyond visual hazards, it's crucial to consider hazards due to various forms of energy:</p>

                        <p>This system mirrors the general project risk management processes (Plan, Identify, Analyze, Respond, Monitor/Control) but is specifically focused on controlling accidental loss in a safety context. The "Treat" strategy here is analogous to "Mitigate".</p>

                            <li><strong>Output of Risk Assessment:</strong> Includes hazard identification, evaluation of existing controls, estimation of severity and probability, and a qualitative risk ranking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Risk Management System (Safety):</strong> A cycle of Identifying exposures, Evaluating risks, Developing control plans (Terminate, Treat, Tolerate, Transfer), Implementing, and Monitoring.</li>
