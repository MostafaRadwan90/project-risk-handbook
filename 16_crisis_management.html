                    <p>While risk management aims to proactively identify and manage potential problems, crises can still occur. Crisis Management is the overall coordination of an organization's response to a crisis, in an effective, timely manner, with the goal of avoiding or minimizing damage to the organization's profitability, reputation, or ability to operate. This chapter outlines the development of a Crisis Management System (CMS) and examines real-world case studies.</p>

                    <p>The main aims of a CMS are to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ensure proper Management of Crises and enable Business Continuity:</strong> To handle disruptive events effectively while maintaining essential business functions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Allow the company to respond to unexpected events or situations</strong> with potentially negative effects that threaten resources and people or the success and continued operation of the facilities.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Developing a robust CMS typically involves several phases, as outlined on Slide 177. We will explore each in more detail.</p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">
                        <p><i>Slide 177 shows a 5-phase arrow: 1. Reviewing Existing Situation → 2. Evaluating Crises and Planning Response → 3. Documenting the CMS → 4. Awareness and Training → 5. Implementing the System.</i></p>

                    <h3>16.2.1 Phase 1: Reviewing the Existing Situation (Slides 178-182)</h3>
                    <div class="phase-box">
                        <h4>Activities (Slide 178):</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identification of all Crises exposures that the company’s facilities may face.</li>
                            <li>Evaluation of any/all existing Crisis Management Practices within the company.</li>
                            <li>Evaluation of response to Crises faced in past years.</li>
                        </ul>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Crisis Classification Models (Slide 179)</h4>
                    <p>Understanding how to classify crises is essential. Slide 179 suggests methods like "By Origin," "By Category," and using a "Matrix." The most appropriate classification method will be selected during the project.</p>

                    <h5>A. Crisis Classification by Origin (ISO 22361:2022 (E)) (Slide 180)</h5>
                    <div class="classification-model-box">
                        <p><strong>Origins of Crises</strong></p>

                    </div>

                    <h5>B. Classification of Crisis by Category (Slide 181)</h5>
                    <p>Examples of categories include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Natural (e.g., earthquakes, floods)</li>
                        <li>Technological (e.g., industrial accidents, system failures)</li>
                        <li>Confrontation (e.g., boycotts, strikes)</li>
                        <li>Malevolence (e.g., terrorism, sabotage, cyberattacks)</li>
                        <li>Organizational Misdeeds (e.g., skewed management values, deception, misconduct)</li>
                        <li>Due to Workplace Violence</li>
                        <li>Due to Rumors</li>
                        <li>Financial (e.g., shortage of funds, bankruptcy)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>C. Matrix Classification of Crisis (Slide 182)</h5>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">
                        <p><i>Slide 182 depicts a 2x2 matrix for crisis classification.
                        <br><strong>Axes:</strong> Technical/Economic (Vertical) vs. Internal/External (Horizontal).
                        <br><strong>Quadrants with examples:</strong>
                        <br>- Top-Left (Internal, Technical/Economic): IT/Systems breakdown, Contamination, Industrial Accident.
                        <br>- Top-Right (External, Technical/Economic): Industrial Accidents, Government Crisis, Utilities Failure, Natural Disasters, Supplier Failure.
                        <br>- Bottom-Left (Internal, People/Social): On-site Product Tampering, Malicious Acts, Organizational Failure.
                        <br>- Bottom-Right (External, People/Social): Sabotage, Terrorism, Labour Strikes, Off-site Product Tampering.</i>

                    <h4>Planning for Crisis Management (Slide 184)</h4>
                    <p>This involves several layers of planning:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>General:</strong> Set parameters for strategy and planning stages; define structure, roles, responsibility, and authority.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal & Other Requirements:</strong> Maintain legal, regulatory, and other instructions related to threats and risks applicable to the company.</li>
                        <li><strong>Risk Assessment & Impact Analysis:</strong> Hazard, risk, and threat identification; Risk Assessment; Impact analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>CM Plan:</strong> Trigger for activation of the plan; Alert and Activation Procedure; Types of Crises; Stages of Crises; Crisis Response Action Steps.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Types of Response Stages (Slide 185)</h4>
                    <div class="image-placeholder">
                        <p><i>Slide 185 shows a flow:
                        <br>1. Gain and maintain situational awareness → [Immediate Response Stage]
                        <br>2. Activate Crises Response plan and deploy resources → [Immediate Response Stage continues]
                        <br>3. Coordinate response and communicate → [Transitional Response Stage]
                        <br>4. Monitor, recover and repair → [Recovery Stage]
                        <br>5. De-mobilize → [Recovery Stage continues]</i>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Types of Crises (by Impact Level - Slide 186)</h4>
                    <p>Slide 186 presents a tiered model of crises based on impact, suggesting different response coordination needs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Type 1 Crisis (Internal Impact):</strong> Can be resolved with existing resources or limited assistance (e.g., Minor Structural Damage). Response involves immediate actions, transitional steps, and recovery, often managed internally.</li>
                        <li><strong>Type 2 Crisis (Public Impact):</strong> Requires considerable coordination with external jurisdictions (e.g., Hostage situation). Response involves Basic Life Support (BLS), potential company-wide coordination, and external agency involvement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Type 3 Crisis (National Impact):</strong> Catastrophic event involving entire surrounding/extended community, beyond emergency response capabilities of internal resources (e.g., Major Earthquake). Response involves BLS, coordination with and often leadership by Relevant Government Authority.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This slide also links these types to Strategic, Tactical, and Operational levels of response.</p>

                            <li><strong>Crisis Management System (CMS):</strong> Aims to ensure proper management of crises, enable business continuity, and allow effective response to unexpected negative events.</li>
                            <li><strong>CMS Development Phases:</strong> 1. Review Existing Situation; 2. Evaluate Exposures & Plan Response; 3. Document CMS; 4. Awareness & Training; 5. Implement System.</li>
                            <li><strong>Crisis Classification:</strong> Can be done by origin (disruptive incidents, operating fluctuations, poorly managed incidents), category (natural, technological, malevolence, etc.), or using a matrix (Internal/External vs. Technical/People impact).</li>
                            <li><strong>Crisis Response:</strong> Involves immediate, transitional, and recovery stages. Different types of crises (Internal, Public, National) require different levels of coordination.</li>
                            <li><strong>CMS Documentation:</strong> Includes policy, governance, procedures, response instructions, and supporting documents, often organized around a Crisis Command Structure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Awareness & Training:</strong> Crucial for effective CMS implementation, involving communication, training for coordinators and teams.</li>
                            <li><strong>Case Studies:</strong> Highlight the importance of proactive planning, swift and empathetic communication, transparency, and taking responsibility in managing crises effectively (e.g., Tylenol) versus the negative impacts of poor handling (e.g., Samsung Note 7, United Airlines).</li>
