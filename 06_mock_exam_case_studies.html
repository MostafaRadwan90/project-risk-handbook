            <h2>Section 2: Short Answer Questions</h2>
            <p>These questions require concise explanations of key concepts.</p>

            <div class="question-block" id="saq1">
                <div class="question-text">1. Explain the difference between Residual Risk and Secondary Risk. Provide a brief example for each. (5 Marks)</div>

                    <p><strong class="answer-label">Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Residual Risk:</strong> This is the risk that remains *after* a risk response has been implemented. It's the "leftover" risk because responses are rarely 100% effective (unless it's avoidance).</p>
                    <p><em>Example:</em> To mitigate the risk of a supplier delay, the project orders materials two weeks earlier than needed. The residual risk is that the supplier could still be delayed by more than two weeks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Secondary Risk:</strong> This is a new risk that arises as a *direct consequence* of implementing a risk response to an original risk.</p>
                    <p><em>Example:</em> To transfer the risk of in-house software development delays, the project outsources the work to a vendor. A secondary risk created is "the vendor might deliver poor quality software."</p>
                    <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: These are distinct types of risks that emerge during or after response planning. (Ref: Handbook Part 4, Key Response Planning Concepts; Slides: Project Risk Management - Part 1, Slide 52; Mock Exam 3, Q1 SA)</p>

                    <p>The five stages of the Loss Causation Model are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Control:</strong> Deficiencies in the management system (e.g., inadequate programs, standards, or compliance). These are the ultimate root causes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Basic Causes (Root Causes):</strong> Underlying reasons why immediate causes exist. Categorized as Personal Factors (e.g., lack of skill, improper motivation) and System/Job Factors (e.g., poor design, inadequate leadership).</li>
                        <li><strong>Immediate Causes (Direct Causes/Symptoms):</strong> Unsafe acts and/or unsafe conditions that directly preceded the incident (e.g., operating without authority, defective equipment).</li>
                        <li><strong>Incident (The Accident Event):</strong> The actual event where contact is made with a source of energy or substance above a threshold limit (e.g., struck by, fall).</li>
                        <li><strong>Loss:</strong> The undesired outcome of the incident (e.g., injury, property damage, environmental damage).</li>

                            <p><strong>Inadequately Performed/Urgently Needed Process:</strong> "Plan Risk Responses" was inadequately performed for the developer risk, as no specific contingency plan was developed. "Control Risks" is now urgently needed. This includes identifying the new API challenges (new risks), reassessing existing risks (like the impact of the developer leaving), and potentially developing workarounds or new response plans.

                            <p><strong>Developer's Resignation:</strong> Now that the developer has resigned, this risk has materialized and become an "Issue" or a "Problem" that needs immediate management, rather than a future uncertainty. (General PM concept)</p>

                                <li><strong>Identify and Analyze:</strong> Formally identify the API challenges as new risks (or issues if they are already causing problems). Perform a quick qualitative (and possibly quantitative if impact is severe) analysis to understand their probability and impact.</li>
                                <li><strong>Develop Workaround/Response:</strong> Brainstorm potential solutions or workarounds for the API issues. This might involve seeking expert help, exploring alternative APIs, or adjusting project scope/functionality. (Ref: Handbook Part 4, Workaround definition)</li>

                                <li><strong>Developer Leaving:</strong> A <strong>Contingency Reserve</strong> (time/budget) could have been allocated if this "known-unknown" risk had a more robust contingency plan (e.g., budget for a contractor, time buffer for handover).</li>
                                <li><strong>API Issues (Unanticipated):</strong> If truly unanticipated, these "unknown-unknowns" would typically be addressed from the <strong>Management Reserve</strong>. (Ref: Handbook Part 4, Reserve definitions)</li>

                            <p><strong>Response Strategy for Developer Risk:</strong> The implicit strategy was likely "Acceptance" (possibly active if "try to retain staff" involved minor actions, or passive if no real plan was made). Given it was identified as a medium risk, passive acceptance or a very weak active acceptance was likely inappropriate. A more robust "Mitigation" (e.g., cross-training, documentation) or "Active Acceptance" with a clear contingency plan (e.g., pre-identified contractor) would have been better.

Missing guardrails (a collective measure) forces reliance on harnesses (personal measure), and even those are not being used. Also, "Ensure everyone knows what they need to do to remain safe and healthy" is violated by poor communication of the H&S plan.

                <p>A study on a toll road project in Indonesia (Semarang-Solo Section I) examined risk perceptions from multiple stakeholders: contractor, owner, design consultant, supervisory consultant, and the local community.

                            <p><strong>Low RMII Indication:</strong> A low RMII indicates that formal risk management processes and practices are not being widely or consistently adopted or applied in these small construction projects. Fewer than half of the surveyed projects employed RM. (Ref: Assignment 1 Summary - Key Findings on Implementation Status)</p>

                            <p><strong>Impact of Government Incentives:</strong> Government incentives like grants and tax rebates would most directly help overcome the barriers of <strong>lack of budget</strong> and the perception that RM is <strong>not economical</strong>. They provide financial resources or reduce the financial burden of implementing RM. (Ref: Assignment 1 Summary - Conclusions and Recommendations)</p>

                            <p><strong>Misunderstanding if RM is "Not Economical":</strong> They might be focusing only on the upfront costs of implementing RM (e.g., time for meetings, cost of software/consultants) without fully appreciating the potential long-term cost savings from preventing or mitigating risks. Effective RM aims to reduce overall project costs by avoiding expensive problems, rework, delays, and disputes, which often far outweigh the initial investment in RM. They may not be considering the cost of *not* doing risk management. (General RM principle)</p>
