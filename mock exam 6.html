                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Tracking identified risks:</strong> Continuously monitoring the status of risks that have been documented in the risk register.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitoring residual risks:</strong> Keeping an eye on risks that remain after response plans have been implemented.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identifying new risks:</strong> Recognizing and documenting any new risks that emerge as the project progresses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Evaluating risk process effectiveness:</strong> Assessing whether the planned risk management processes and specific responses are working as intended and achieving their goals throughout the project.</li>
                    <li>(Additionally: Implementing risk response plans as needed when triggers occur, and looking for risk triggers).</li>

                <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>In the context of a Safety Policy, safety objectives should be "SMART":</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Objectives should be clear, well-defined, and unambiguous, stating exactly what is to be achieved in terms of safety performance. (e.g., "Reduce manual handling injuries in the fabrication workshop.")</li>
                    <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Objectives should be quantifiable so that progress towards achieving them can be tracked and assessed. (e.g., "Reduce manual handling injuries by 15%.")</li>
                    <li><strong>Achievable (or Agreed/Assignable):</strong> Objectives should be realistic and attainable given the available resources, constraints, and capabilities of the organization or project. They should also be agreed upon by those responsible for their implementation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relevant (or Realistic):</strong> Objectives should be pertinent to the overall safety policy and the specific safety goals of the organization or project. They should contribute to improving safety performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Objectives should have a defined timeframe or deadline for achievement, creating a sense of urgency and allowing for progress monitoring. (e.g., "Reduce manual handling injuries by 15% within the next 12 months.")</li>

            <!-- From provided question bank (As the project manager in a software project...) -->
            <div class="bank-question-note">From provided question bank.</div>
            <div class="question-text">4. As the project manager in a software project, which is currently initiated, you want to assess high-level risks. What should you do?</div>
            <ul class="options-list">
                <li>A. Develop the project charter and a risk management plan to start identifying risks based on both and other documents.</li>
                <li>B. Identify and analyze risk events using qualitative and quantitative techniques.</li>
                <li>C. Develop contingency plans and fallback plans in case the original plan proves wrong.</li>
                <li>D. Discuss the risks documented in your risk register with the project key stakeholders.</li>
            </ul>
            <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm btn-show-answer" onclick="toggleAnswer('mock4_mcq1')">Show Answer</button>
            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>Correct Answer: A</strong></p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: At the initiation phase, high-level risks are often identified based on the project charter (which contains high-level project information and objectives). Developing the Risk Management Plan sets the framework for how all risk activities, including identification, will be conducted. Detailed analysis (B, C) and discussing a full risk register (D) come later. (Handbook Chapter 2)</p>

        </div>

        <div class="question-block" id="mock4_mcq2">

            <div class="bank-question-note">From provided question bank.</div>
            <div class="question-text">5. You are running a major project with four sub-projects. Each sub-project manager has developed a risk management plan, identified many risks, analyzed them, and planned for risk response. It is now two months later. What should you NOT do?</div>
            <ul class="options-list">
                <li>A. Ensure that they handle all risks to save you from project level risk control.</li>
                <li>B. Make sure that the sub-project managers monitor their project work for new and changing risk.</li>
                <li>C. Make sure that the sub-project managers keep track of the identified risks and those on the watch list.</li>
                <li>D. Make sure that the sub-project managers monitor triggers conditions for contingency plans.</li>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>Correct Answer: A</strong></p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: As the overall project manager, you retain ultimate responsibility for project-level risks and overall risk integration. While sub-project managers handle risks within their scope, you cannot completely abdicate project-level risk control and oversight. Options B, C, and D are appropriate monitoring activities. (General project management principles)</p>

            <div class="question-text">6. During risk identification sessions, you and your team identify more than 150 risks for your project. You are afraid that evaluating each of these risks quantitatively will cost you an enormous amount of time, while not all of them are relevant and important enough to justify such measure. What should you do next?</div>
            <ul class="options-list">
                <li>A. Identify risk triggers where possible. Analyze only those risks quantitatively for which no trigger could be found.</li>
                <li>B. Use qualitative risk analysis in order to prioritize risks for further action, such as quantitative risk analysis.</li>
                <li>C. Assess the probability of each risk qualitatively and further analyze only those risks with high probability.</li>
                <li>D. Assess the potential impact of each risk qualitatively and further analyze only those risks with high impact.</li>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>Correct Answer: B</strong></p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: Qualitative risk analysis is specifically designed to rapidly assess and prioritize a large number of identified risks based on both their probability and impact. This allows the team to focus more intensive quantitative analysis on the highest-priority risks. Analyzing only by probability (C) or only by impact (D) is incomplete. (Handbook Chapter 5)</p>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>Correct Answer: B</strong></p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: Risk management primarily deals with "known unknowns" – risks that have been identified but whose occurrence or impact is uncertain. "Known knowns" are facts/constraints. "Unknown unknowns" are handled by management reserves. While identifying new risks (A) is part of it, "known unknowns" best describes the core subject of analysis. (Handbook Chapter 7, Slide 53 - regarding reserves)</p>

            <div class="question-text">8. Regular reporting is an important component of:</div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <p><strong>Correct Answer: D</strong> (and C)</p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: Regular reporting is a key aspect of Communication Management. It also supports Monitoring and Control processes by providing status updates. Given the options, Communication is the most direct fit as a process group/knowledge area where reporting is fundamental.

                <p><strong>Correct Answer: B</strong></p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: Risk Monitoring and Control (Control Risks) is the process that tracks identified risks, monitors residual risks, identifies new risks, and evaluates the effectiveness of the risk process throughout the project. This includes assessing changes in risk status. (Handbook Chapter 9)</p>

                <p><strong>Correct Answer: A</strong></p>
                <p class="rationale-text">Rationale: A core rule of brainstorming is to encourage free-flowing ideas and defer judgment or criticism until a later stage to foster creativity and a comprehensive list of potential risks. While Delphi involves expert input, its structured rounds are different from this "no criticism" principle of idea generation phase. (Handbook Chapter 4, Slide 25)</p>
